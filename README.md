## Analysis of Melbourne Housing Prices
I used a docker-compose file to set up a local Spark cluster environment and a Hadoop cluster to store data.

The data and the jupyter notebook containing the analysis can be found in the nbs folder. I applied a Linear Regression Model and Random Forest Regression model to predict the value of houses.
